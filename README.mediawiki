''Know what you eat''

'''This is a learning app!'''
Meaning: I'm still learning Ruby and the Rails architecture and although I'm very familiar with MVC and other programming languages, coming to Ruby means learning everything again. I will mess up a lot. And that's ok but beware! If you have something to add, *by all means, do so*.

This project represents my efforts towards creating a calculator for foods. Each food has a certain quantity of points based on their attributes. The user will fill in these attributes and the app will present the total of points it represents.

Simple as that.

There are a lot of features I see coming in the near future though, such as:
* A user can register in the site to have more features;
* Profile calculator: Give the user the amount of points he/she should eat a day based on their age, weight and other attributes;
* Ability for registered users to add their own food and record it for future use;
* Ability for registered users to access the NHAM database of already recorded common foods;
* ...and a lot more.

It's mainly a fun project which is why I'm putting it free and open source. It's my way to learn and give back some of my knowledge to the community. Also, I'm fat and need to educate myself to eat well again :'(
